                    <p>At Logo Visioneer, the privacy of our clients is our top priority, and our website, <a href="https://www.logovisioneer.com">www.logovisioneer.com</a>, duly respects it. While we collect information from our clients, it is solely used to enhance our customer services. Our company acknowledges that the maintenance and use of our clients' information is our responsibility. We DO NOT rent or sell the information that our clients provide us online.</p>
                    <p>This policy explains how we use the personal information collected, why we collect it, and how we use it. It also outlines the choices you can make about how your information is collected and used.</p>

                    <h3>Personal Information Collected</h3>
                    <p>We collect the client’s name, email, mailing address, and phone number. This information is provided by the client when ordering or saving information with our company. Additionally, email addresses or mailing addresses received through our mailing system, such as the Contact Us Form, are used to respond to comments and queries.</p>
                    <p>We also maintain records of the items that have interested our clients in the past, as well as the client’s purchases online.</p>

                    <h3>Use of Collected Data</h3>
                    <p>The collected data is used in several ways. It helps us process client orders, confirm orders via email, and contact clients via phone, mailing address, or email for any queries regarding placed orders.</p>
                    <p>Clients may also receive updates regarding our site and services, including newsletters and promotional offers. Additionally, information about client interests and purchases helps us improve our site design and enhance the client’s shopping experience.</p>
                    <p>If you no longer wish to receive newsletters and promotional communications, you can opt out by following the instructions included in each newsletter or contacting us via email or phone at <?php echo $phone ?>.</p>

                    <h3>Social Media (Features) and Widgets</h3>
                    <p>Our website includes Social Media Features such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets like the Share button. These features may collect your IP address, the page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>

                    <h3>3rd Party Sharing</h3>
                    <p>Personal information will not be released to third parties unless described in this policy. We do not sell personal information under any circumstances.</p>
                    <p>We use credit card processing companies to bill clients for services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. Similarly, customer support chat providers may use the information solely to deliver their services to us.</p>

                    <h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
                    <p>We secure client information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information during transmission. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can email us at info@logovisioneer.com.</p>

                    <h3>Cookies and Their Use</h3>
                    <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers transferred to clients’ hard drives through web browsers, enabling our systems to recognize their browsers and store items in their shopping carts during visits. Most browsers offer help sections to explain how to prevent the acceptance of new cookies or disable them altogether. However, we recommend accepting cookies to utilize all the features of our website fully.</p>
                    <p>We also track IP addresses to diagnose server problems and gather broad demographic information such as location and internet service provider. These logs are not tied to personally identifiable information.</p>

                    <p>With your consent, we may post your testimonial alongside your name. If you wish to remove your testimonial, please contact us.</p>
