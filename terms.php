             <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Refund Policy</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">A refund request will not be entertained under the following conditions:
</p>
<p>• If the primary design concept for a website or logo is approved and the project has entered the development stage, a refund cannot be issued.
</p>


<p>• If revisions have been requested beyond the number included in your package, additional revisions will incur a small fee instead of a refund.

</p>


<p>• If the cancellation is due to reasons unrelated to the company or its policies, a refund will not be granted.
</p>
<p>• If there has been no communication with the company for more than 2 weeks after project initiation, the refund policy will be void.
</p>
<p>• If the company’s policies or terms have been violated, a refund will not be processed.
</p>
<p>• If another company or designer has been approached for the same project while working with Design Pioneer Studio, the refund will not be applicable.
</p>
<p>• If the creative brief lacks the required details or does not clearly express the vision for the project, the refund will not be granted.
</p>
<p>• If a complete design change is requested after the design has been approved via call or email, the refund policy will not apply.
</p>
<p>• If the request for a refund is made after the allowed time frame, it will not be processed.
</p>
<p>• If the business is closing or changing its name, services, or operations, a refund cannot be requested.
</p>
<p>• Refunds will not be granted for reasons such as ‘change of mind,’ ‘disagreement with a partner,’ or any other non-service-related reasons.
</p>
<p>• If a client purchases a service bundle and is dissatisfied with one specific service, only that service will be eligible for a refund, not the entire bundle.
</p>
<p>• Once the final design files have been delivered at the client’s request, a refund will no longer be possible.
</p>
<p>• Items provided for free within a package do not qualify for a refund or revision.
</p>
<p>• If a client approves any design, whether it be a logo, website, or any other service, they will no longer be eligible for a refund.
</p>
<p>• Services including Social Media, SEO, Domain Registration, and Web Hosting are non-refundable under any circumstances.
</p>

<p>• For websites, once the design has been approved and the project has moved to the development phase, refunds will not be granted for logos, marketing campaigns, animations, SEO, or other related services.
</p>
<p><strong>Note:<strong> Design Pioneer Studio reserves the right to reject any project or cancel the contract at its discretion. If a refund is processed, the client will lose all rights to the designs, and they will become the exclusive property of Design Pioneer Studio.</p>
