             <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Refund Policy</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Logo Visioneer refund policy will be void if:</p>
<p>• You have chosen an all-in-one package.</p>
<p>• The primary design concept has been approved.</p>
<p>• You have requested revisions.</p>
<p>• The cancellation is due to reasons unrelated to the company or its policies.</p>
<p>• The company has not been contacted for more than 2 weeks after project initiation.</p>
<p>• The company’s policies, or policy, have been violated.</p>
<p>• Another company or designer apart from Logo Visioneer has been approached for the same project.</p>
<p>• The creative brief lacks the required information.</p>
<p>• A complete design change has been demanded.</p>
<p>• The claim has crossed the given ‘request for refund’ time frame.</p>
<p>• The business is closing or changing its name or operations.</p>
<p>• Reasons such as ‘change of mind,’ ‘disagreement with a partner,’ or other non-service-related reasons will not qualify for a refund under any circumstances.</p>
<p>• If a client subscribes to a service bundle and is dissatisfied with a specific service, the refund will only apply to that particular service and not the entire bundle.</p>
<p>• No refund can be claimed or processed once the final files have been delivered upon your request.</p>
<p>• Refunds and revisions explicitly do not apply to items offered for free.</p>
<p>• The client will not be entitled to any refunds after 30 days from the date of purchase.</p>
<p>• Services such as Social Media, SEO, Domain Registration, and Web Hosting are not eligible for refunds under any circumstances.</p>
<p>• For websites, refunds will not be entertained once the client has approved the design and the website has entered the development phase.</p>
<p>Note: Logo Visioneer reserves the right to reject any project or cancel the contract when deemed necessary. After the refund, you will not retain rights to use the designs for any purpose; they will become the sole property of Logo Visioneer.</p>
